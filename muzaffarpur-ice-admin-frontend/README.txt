Readme for Backend Integration
* All pages are connected to the same sidebar.js for sidebar, theme, etc.
* Each page has its own JS file (e.g., orders.js) with dummy functions.
* Use the following ids and classes in JS to send or get data from backend:
o Consumers Form:
* #customerName, #customerAddress, #customerContact, #customerRate
o Orders Table:
* .order-row, .edit-btn, .delete-btn, #addOrderBtn
o Sales Report:
* #reportType, #startDate, #endDate, #showGraphBtn
